SpeechBlinker
=============

A small iOS app that uses Open Ears to manipulate UI elements and eventually an Arduino over BLE

To get started, try saying 'toggle lights'. This should change the slider to the on position. Other available commands include:
* 'Light(s) on'
* 'Light(s) off'
* 'Change model'

Note that this project requires the OpenEars framework, SLT voice framework, and the English accoustical model. These files can be found at [Politepix.com](http://www.politepix.com/openears/).
